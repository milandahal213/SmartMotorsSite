        - title: Implementation
          content: Smart SPIKE uses LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime set to implement the Smart Motor concept. It uses ports on the left (A,C,E) for sensors (Force, Distance and Color) and ports on the right (B, D, F) for motors (both medium and large). There can be a single sensor to single motor (1 to 3 pairs at a time) configuration or single to multi motor pairing configuration. The LED matrix shows the configuration of the input and output. Users use the left and right buttons to navigate.
        - title: Navigation
          content: The system starts up in configuration mode. In this mode, the users can plug in the sensors and motors. The lines on the LED matrix show how the sensors and motors are related. Pressing the right button locks the configration. Now for each configuration the user takes data using the left button. Right button press takes the system to play mode. 
        - title: Training and Operation
          content:  In the train mode, user creates sensor-motor associations by positioning the motor at desired locations and pressing the left button while the sensor registered specific readings like holding the distance sensor at a certain distance for that motor position. Each successful pairing is indicated by a beep, confirming data storage. After taking data for the confuration, pressing the right button either goes to training mode for another configuration (if there are multiple sensor- motor pairs) or goes to Play Mode, where the motor responds automatically based on trained sensor-motor relationships. Right button press will exit the play mode.

          src: "/assets/images/prototypes/prototype-1-main.png"
          description: This is a typical configuration with a single sensor on port A and motor on port B. The sensor can be plugged in any one of the three ports on the left (A,C,E) and the motor can be plugged into any of the ports in the right (B, D, F). 
        - title: Multiple single sensor - single motor
          src: "/assets/images/prototypes/prototype-1-multi-single.png"
          description: There can be more than one single sensor single motor pairs. If the system detects more than one sensor and more than one motor it pairs the adjacent sensor and motor (A and B, C and D, E and F).
        - title: Single sensor - multi motor
          src: "/assets/images/prototypes/prototype-1-multi-sensor-motor.png"
          description: One sensor can control multiple motors at the same time. If the system detects a single sensor with more than one motor it enables this configuration. The motors can be programmed to go to different positions for same sensor input.
