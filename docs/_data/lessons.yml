  # Novel Engineering
  - id: novel-engineering
    title: "Novel Engineering"
    subtitle: "Novel Engineering is an innovative educational approach that combines literacy and engineering by having students solve problems faced by characters in books they're reading. Developed by Tufts University, this method transforms story characters into 'clients' who need engineering solutions, allowing students to identify problems from the text and design real solutions through hands-on building and iteration. This approach makes engineering accessible and exciting while simultaneously strengthening both literacy comprehension and engineering design skills across elementary and middle school classrooms."
