    subtitle: "LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime based Smart Motor"
    short_description: "Smart SPIKE uses LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime hub, sensors and motors to implement the Smart Motors concept. Once set up the Smart SPIKE code can be run from the hub directly. It supports single sensor - single motor, single sensor - multi motor as well as multi sensor - multi motor setup. "

        - title: Implementation
          content: Smart Wio uses LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime and integrates a servo motor with a Grove rotary encoder. The system utilizes the Wio Terminal's 2.4-inch color LCD screen (320 x 240 pixels) for the user interface, while the 3 configurable buttons and 5-way switch provide user input controls. The servo motor occupies one Grove-compatible sensor port, with the rotary encoder using the second available port. Beyond the rotary encoder, Smart Wio incorporates the onboard light sensor and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for additional sensor input.
        - title: Navigation
          content: The system defaults to tilt sensor upon startup. From the Home Screen users can access two main functions- navigate to the Sensor Select Screen or proceed directly to the Train Screen. The Sensor Select Screen allows users to choose from three available sensors - light, tilt, or rotary encoder. The Home Screen provides visual feedback through a sensor icon in the top-right corner and an interactive graph displaying real-time sensor readings alongside motor position. Users can manually control the motor by pressing the 5-way switch left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise).
        - title: Training and Operation
          content:  In the Train Screen, user creates sensor-motor associations by positioning the motor at desired locations and pressing the 5-way switch while the sensor registered specific readings. Each successful pairing generates a dot on the grid interface, confirming data storage. Pressing the C button (marked with a play icon) activates Play Mode, where the motor responds automatically based on trained sensor-motor relationships. The Play Screen offers additional functionality- users can edit existing data via the C button or select between two algorithms — nearest neighbor or linear regression—for processing the training data in Model Selection Screen.

          description: The screen shows the training screen. The Y-axis is the sensor value and X-axis is the motor position. Motor can be moved using the button in bottom right (left and right). Colors of the dots represent live sensor-motor pairings as well as previous data points. User has option to cancel, delete previous data point or to go to Play Screen.
