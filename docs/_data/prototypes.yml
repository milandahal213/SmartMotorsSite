    subtitle: "LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime based Smart Motor"
    short_description: "Smart SPIKE uses LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime hub, sensors and motors to implement the Smart Motors concept. Once set up the Smart SPIKE code can be run from the hub directly. It supports single sensor - single motor, single sensor - multi motor as well as multi sensor - multi motor setup. "

        - title: Implementation
          content: Smart SPIKE uses LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime set to implement the Smart Motor concept. It uses ports on the left (A,C,E) for sensors (Force, Distance and Color) and ports on the right (B, D, F) for motors (both medium and large). There can be a single sensor to single motor (1 to 3 pairs at a time) configuration or single to multi motor pairing configuration. The LED matrix shows the configuration of the input and output. Users use the left and right buttons to navigate.
        - title: Navigation
          content: The system starts up in configuration mode. In this mode, the users can plug in the sensors and motors. The lines on the LED matrix show how the sensors and motors are related. Pressing the right button locks the configration. Now for each configuration the user takes data using the left button. Right button press takes the system to play mode. 
        - title: Training and Operation
          content:  In the train mode, user creates sensor-motor associations by positioning the motor at desired locations and pressing the left button while the sensor registered specific readings like holding the distance sensor at a certain distance for that motor position. Each successful pairing is indicated by a beep, confirming data storage. After taking data for the confuration, pressing the right button either goes to training mode for another configuration (if there are multiple sensor- motor pairs) or goes to Play Mode, where the motor responds automatically based on trained sensor-motor relationships. Right button press will exit the play mode.

        - title: Single sensor - single motor
          src: "/assets/images/prototypes/prototype-1-main.png"
          description: This is a typical configuration with a single sensor on port A and motor on port B. The sensor can be plugged in any one of the three ports on the left (A,C,E) and the motor can be plugged into any of the ports in the right (B, D, F). 
        - title: Multiple single sensor - single motor
          src: "/assets/images/prototypes/prototype-1-multi-single.png"
          description: There can be more than one single sensor single motor pairs. If the system detects more than one sensor and more than one motor it pairs the adjacent sensor and motor (A and B, C and D, E and F).
        - title: Single sensor - multi motor
          src: "/assets/images/prototypes/prototype-1-multi-sensor-motor.png"
          description: One sensor can control multiple motors at the same time. If the system detects a single sensor with more than one motor it enables this configuration. The motors can be programmed to go to different positions for same sensor input.

    title: "Smart WIO"
    subtitle: "Wio Terminal based Smart Motor"
    short_description: "Smart WIO uses Seeedstudio's Wio Terminal, Grove servo and Grove encoder to implement the Smart Motor concept. The on-board light sensor and accelerometer as well as color display make this version of Smart Motor compact.
    This prototype was developed to explore the use of color display to communicate information about data, training, states to the user. "

        - title: Implementation
          content: Smart Wio uses Seeed Studio's Wio Terminal microcontroller and integrates a servo motor with a Grove rotary encoder. The system utilizes the Wio Terminal's 2.4-inch color LCD screen (320 x 240 pixels) for the user interface, while the 3 configurable buttons and 5-way switch provide user input controls. The servo motor occupies one Grove-compatible sensor port, with the rotary encoder using the second available port. Beyond the rotary encoder, Smart Wio incorporates the onboard light sensor and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for additional sensor input.
        - title: Navigation
          content: The system defaults to tilt sensor upon startup. From the Home Screen users can access two main functions- navigate to the Sensor Select Screen or proceed directly to the Train Screen. The Sensor Select Screen allows users to choose from three available sensors - light, tilt, or rotary encoder. The Home Screen provides visual feedback through a sensor icon in the top-right corner and an interactive graph displaying real-time sensor readings alongside motor position. Users can manually control the motor by pressing the 5-way switch left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise).
        - title: Training and Operation
          content:  In the Train Screen, user creates sensor-motor associations by positioning the motor at desired locations and pressing the 5-way switch while the sensor registered specific readings. Each successful pairing generates a dot on the grid interface, confirming data storage. Pressing the C button (marked with a play icon) activates Play Mode, where the motor responds automatically based on trained sensor-motor relationships. The Play Screen offers additional functionality- users can edit existing data via the C button or select between two algorithms — nearest neighbor or linear regression—for processing the training data in Model Selection Screen.
