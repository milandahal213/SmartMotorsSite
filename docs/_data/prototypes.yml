        ## Getting Started with Smart SPIKE

        The Smart SPIKE prototype introduces students to robotics through hands-on, tactile programming. Instead of writing code, students physically guide the motors to create behaviors that the system learns and remembers.

        ### What You'll Learn
        - Basic robotics concepts and motor control
        - Sensor integration and feedback systems
        - Programming fundamentals through physical interaction
        - Problem-solving skills and creative thinking

        ### Educational Applications
        - **Elementary (Ages 8-11)**: Simple cause-and-effect relationships, basic motor movements
        - **Middle School (Ages 12-14)**: Sensor integration, complex movement patterns
        - **High School (Ages 15-18)**: Advanced programming concepts, research projects

        ### Key Features
        - **Tactile Programming**: Train motors by physically guiding them
        - **Sensor Integration**: Color and force sensors provide rich input data
        - **Visual Feedback**: LED indicators show system status and responses
        - **Modular Design**: Easy to modify and extend with additional LEGO elements

        *More detailed instructions and additional lesson plans are available in the downloadable PDF guide.*
