<h1>Research</h1>

<p>Our Research Smart Motors represents the culmination of years of research in robotics, education, and human-computer interaction. Our research focuses on creating accessible and intuitive robotic systems that enhance learning experiences across various educational contexts.</p>

<h2>Key Research Areas</h2>

<h3>Educational Robotics</h3>
<p>Our team investigates how robotics can be effectively integrated into educational settings to enhance STEM learning outcomes. We study the impact of hands-on, screen-free experiences on student engagement and comprehension.</p>

<h3>Gesture-Based Programming</h3>
<p>We've developed innovative gesture-based programming interfaces that allow users to program Smart Motors through natural movements and demonstrations, eliminating the need for traditional coding knowledge.</p>

<h3>Adaptive Learning Systems</h3>
<p>Our research explores how robotic systems can adapt to individual learning styles and preferences, creating personalized educational experiences that meet the needs of diverse learners.</p>
