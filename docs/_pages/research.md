# Our Research

Smart Motors represents the culmination of years of research in robotics, education, and human-computer interaction. Our research focuses on creating accessible and intuitive robotic systems that enhance learning experiences across various educational contexts.

## Key Research Areas

### Educational Robotics

Our team investigates how robotics can be effectively integrated into educational settings to enhance STEM learning outcomes. We study the impact of hands-on, screen-free experiences on student engagement and comprehension.

### Gesture-Based Programming

We've developed innovative gesture-based programming interfaces that allow users to program Smart Motors through natural movements and demonstrations, eliminating the need for traditional coding knowledge.

### Adaptive Learning Systems

Our research explores how robotic systems can adapt to individual learning styles and preferences, creating personalized educational experiences that meet the needs of diverse learners.
